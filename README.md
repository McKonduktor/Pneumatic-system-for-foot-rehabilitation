My Engineer Diploma Thesis Project

This repository includes project of:
1. C programm for ESP32-based electronic circuit controlling the pneumatic system.
2. Mobile app (Kotlin) controlling the circuit via Bluetooth.

  --Thesis summary--
The main objective of this diploma thesis was to create a control system for the pneumatic system for foot rehabilitation. Thesis contains the reasoning for the selection of system components and the design of the electronic circuit. The process of designing a PCB board, which was made with the thermal transfer method, is described. Thesis presents the algorithm of the implemented program controlling the system and enabling connection in the bluetooth protocol. The usage and algorithm of the application for a mobile device, allowing for remote control of the system operation, is explained. The system was pre-tested and calibrated.
